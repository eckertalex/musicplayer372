#DirectoryConfig.txt
#	If you move this file or change its name, update ../include/directoryMannager.hpp
#	If this file is deleted or can't be read, DirectoryManager automatically only looks into "../res/audio" 
#	The Program will run overrides and repositories in order listed in this file. You can set an override,
#		then list a directory, then change the override and list another directory if needed.


#	If the directory is on a different drive, you must override the OS if it's different than the OS
#	running this program. You must also use a direct path to find the external folder. (Must have permissions)



#   OperatingSystemOverride:
#	0 -> program will automatically detect the OS running the program
#	1 -> program will format directories for "linux/MacOS"
#	2 -> program will format directories for "Windows"
#	3 -> program has no idea what path system to use: "Other"
#		Note: if "Other", program will not find any songs. Added for testing purposes

#   UniqueSongOverride:
#	false -> if program finds multiple songs of same name in different directories, will NOT add both
#	true  -> if program finds multiple songs of same name in different directories, it adds both


#IMPORTANT WINDOWS USERS: still type the repositories with "/" below, the program will change them 
#	automatically if needed.
#IF YOUR FILES/FOLDERS CONTAIN SPACES, YOU MUST BACKSLASH THEM OUT: '\ '

#List of orders to run start here:

OperatingSystemOverride = 0
UniqueSongOverride = false
"..\res\audio"
uniquesongoverride=true
../res/audio
